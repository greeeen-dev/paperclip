# Paperclip
An experimental Rust bridge bot that puts bridging speeds first

## What is Paperclip?
Paperclip is an experimental bridge bot that aims to put speed and efficiency first.

## Why did I make Paperclip?
Unifier is already the fastest bridge bots out there, as proved by some
[benchmarks](https://wiki.unifierhq.org/compare/benchmarks) I did a while back. But I still want to see
how I can improve its speed even further, which is why I created this experiment bot.

## So...is Unifier moving from Python to Rust?
Depends, we first need to see how the experiment goes.

## Features (planned)
> [!WARNING]
> Please note that **Paperclip is merely an experiment**. I do not intend to include more features than
> necessary for experimenting with bringing speeds on Rust compared to Python.
>
> If you need a more mature and feature complete bridge bot, consider something like
> [Unifier](https://github.com/UnifierHQ/unifier).

- [ ] Written in Rust instead of Python
- [ ] Multi-server bridge
- [ ] Parallel bridging with multicore support (if possible)
- [ ] Webhook caching (should be possible)
